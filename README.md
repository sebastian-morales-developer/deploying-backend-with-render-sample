NOTE WROTE BY SEBASTIAN:
This example doesn't explain what we have to insert in the textboxes 'build command' and 'start command' during we are filling the deploy form in RENDER. In this case, we are not using a 'yarn.lock' file. Instead, we are using the file named 'package-lock.json'. For this new case, for 'build command' we insert 'npm install' or 'yarn' (https://docs.render.com/deploys#build-command), and for 'start command' we insert 'node app.js' (https://docs.render.com/deploys#start-command).
